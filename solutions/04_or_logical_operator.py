OVERVIEW
--------
    and     every condition must be true
    or      at least one condition must be true 

We'll go over "or" in this file. When using or, as long as at least one of 
the conditions in the if/elif statement is True, then the entire statement
is evaluated as True.

STRUCTURE
---------
and:
    - just put "or" between every logical statement in your if or elif

EXAMPLE
-------
if x == y or y != z:
    print("At least one condition met.")
'''

num_1 = 3
num_2 = 12

# 1. PUT 2 CONDITIONS IN ONE IF STATEMENT
# Print a message if num_1 doesn't equal 2 or if num_2 is above 10
if num_1 != 2 or num_2 > 10:
    print("First: both conditions were correct")

# 2. PUT 2 CONDITIONS IN ONE IF STATEMENT (AGAIN)
# Print a message if iNum doesn't equal 3 or num_2 is above 10
if num_1 != 3 or num_2 > 10:
    print("Second: one condition was correct")

# 3. PUT 2 CONDITIONS IN ONE IF STATEMENT (AGAIN)
# Print message if iNum doesn't equal 3 or num_2 doesn't equal 12
if num_1 != 3 or num_2 != 12:
    print("Third: you shouldn't be seeing this")

# 4. PUT 3 CONDITIONS IN ONE IF STATEMENT (AGAIN)
# Write any if statement you want, but use 3 "or" operators.
# Print something if at least one is true.
if num_1 != 3 or num_2 > 10 or num_1 < num_2 or num_2 == 12:
    print("Fourth: at least one condition is correct")
